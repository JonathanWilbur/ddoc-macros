# DDoc Macros

* Version: [1.0.0](http://semver.org/)

## Usage

There are a few new macros in `macros.ddoc`:

* `LINK` for links
* `PRE` for pre-formatted text (great for code, by the way)
* `PERSON` for an author

## Example

For an example, see [my ASN.1 library](https://github.com/JonathanWilbur/asn1-d),
that uses these macros. The examples can be seen in `documentation/html`.
